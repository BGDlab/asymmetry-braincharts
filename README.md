## Asymmetry braincharts for the lifespan

# This repository contains code to:

Access and visualize left-right regional brain developmental trajectories
 - Plot regional and asymmetry trajectories across age
 - Perform out-of-sample prediction so users can centile-score their own data

# Contents
The fit and bootstrap objects for left and right regional trajectories are in `models-to-share/regional-models`, the asymmetry models are in `models-to-share/asymmetry-models`.  

The repository includes `tutorial.Rmd`, which shows how to plot the trajectories. It also generates sample data, to test the out-of-sample prediction. 

# Requirements
You will need the following R packages:
- `gamlss`
- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
